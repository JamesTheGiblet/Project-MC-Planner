# Project PI Planner - Raspberry Pi Pin Allocation Assistant

![Project PI Planner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Project+PI+Planner+Interface)

A comprehensive visual tool for planning and allocating Raspberry Pi GPIO pins for your electronics projects. This application helps you avoid pin conflicts and generates ready-to-use Python code for your sensor configurations.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Visual Pinout Diagram**: Interactive 40-pin Raspberry Pi layout with color-coded pins
- ðŸ”Œ **Sensor Library**: Pre-configured support for common sensors (DHT11, HC-SR04, PIR, etc.)
- ðŸ¤– **Automatic Allocation**: Intelligent pin assignment based on sensor requirements
- ðŸ’» **Code Generation**: Python code output using RPi.GPIO library
- ðŸŽ¨ **Intuitive UI**: Clean, user-friendly interface with tooltips and visual feedback
- ðŸ”„ **Conflict Prevention**: Prevents double-allocation of pins across sensors

## Supported Sensors

The application currently supports these common sensors and components:

- **DHT11/DHT22** - Temperature and humidity sensor
- **HC-SR04** - Ultrasonic distance sensor
- **PIR Sensor** - Motion detection sensor
- **LDR** - Light dependent resistor (light sensor)
- **Push Button** - Simple input button
- **LED** - Light emitting diode
- **Servo Motor** - Precision rotation motor
- **Relay Module** - Switching module for high-power devices
- **I2C Sensors** - Devices using I2C communication protocol
- **SPI Devices** - Devices using SPI communication protocol

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame library

### Setup

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python pi_planner.py
```

## How to Use

1. **Select a Sensor**: Click on any sensor in the left sidebar
2. **View Allocation**: The application automatically assigns appropriate pins (power, ground, data)
3. **Inspect Pins**: Hover over any pin to see allocation details
4. **Generate Code**: Click "Generate Code" to create Python code for your setup
5. **Clear Allocations**: Use "Clear Allocation" to reset pin assignments

## Understanding the Interface

### Pin Color Coding

- **Blue**: GPIO pins (general purpose input/output)
- **Red**: 5V power pins
- **Light Red**: 3.3V power pins
- **Dark Gray**: Ground (GND) pins
- **Purple**: Special function pins (ID_SD, etc.)

### Visual Indicators

- **Yellow Circle**: Indicates an allocated pin
- **Tooltips**: Hover over pins or buttons for additional information
- **Code Preview**: Generated code appears in the bottom panel

## Generated Code Structure

The application generates Python code that includes:

- Proper GPIO library import
- Pin setup based on your sensor allocations
- Basic program structure with cleanup handling
- Comments indicating sensor purpose and physical pin numbers

Example output:
```python
# Code for using allocated pins
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setwarnings(False)

# DHT11/DHT22 setup
GPIO.setup(2, GPIO.IN)  # DHT11/DHT22 data (physical pin 3)

# Main program loop
try:
    while True:
        # Add your code here
        time.sleep(0.1)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    GPIO.cleanup()
```

## Customization

### Adding New Sensors

You can easily add support for new sensors by modifying the `SENSORS` dictionary in the code:

```python
"Your Sensor Name": {
    "type": "sensor",  # or "input", "output", "actuator"
    "pins": {
        "data_pin_name": "GPIO",  # or "3V3", "5V", "GND"
        # Add more pins as needed
    },
    "power": "3V3",  # or "5V" if required
    "ground": True,  # set to False if not needed
    "notes": "Any additional information"
}
```

### Modifying Pin Layout

The pin layout is defined in the `PIN_LAYOUT` variable. You can modify this to support different Raspberry Pi models or custom pin configurations.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Display not rendering properly**: Ensure you have the latest version of Pygame installed
2. **Code not generating**: Make sure you've selected a sensor before generating code
3. **Pins not allocating**: Some sensors require specific pins (e.g., I2C devices need specific GPIO pins)

### Limitations

- The application currently supports the standard 40-pin Raspberry Pi layout
- I2C and SPI devices may require additional configuration beyond pin allocation
- Physical constraints (like pin proximity) are not considered in automatic allocation
