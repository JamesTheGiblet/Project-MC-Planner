## The Problem You've Faced

If you've ever worked with an SBC, you know the frustration:

- **Endless Pin Puzzles:** Which GPIO can I use? Is this pin for I²C or SPI? Wait, I used that one already...
- **Datasheet Overload:** Dozens of open browser tabs, trying to reconcile board pinouts with component requirements.
- **Costly Mistakes:** A wrong connection or voltage mismatch leads to frustrating debugging or fried components.
- **Messy Documentation:** Final plans are often disorganized, making them hard to share or reproduce.

This process is slow, error-prone, and stifles creativity.

---

## The Intelligent Solution

PinPoint Planner transforms this process into a fast, visual, and reliable workflow. It's your single source of truth for hardware design.

- **Plan Visually:** See your board's pins in real-time. As you add components, the planner shows you exactly what's available.
- **Get Instant Validation:** Our intelligent core automatically flags issues, preventing conflicts before they happen.
- **Generate Docs in One Click:** Export a clean, professional summary of your project, including a component list and pin assignments.

## Two Levels of Intelligence: From Error-Free to Effortless

PinPoint Planner offers two levels of assistance:

### 1. Pin Validator (Free)

- **Real-time spell-checker** for your hardware.
The Pin Validator is like a real-time spell-checker for your hardware:
- **Catches Conflicts:** Instantly flags if a pin is already in use.
- **Prevents Mismatches:** Warns if you try to connect a component to an incompatible bus.
- **Stops Errors Before They Happen:** Ensures every manual connection is valid.

### 2. AI Smart Planner (Pro)

- **One-Click Planning:** Add all your components, click "Plan My Board," and the AI gets to work.
- **Holistic Optimization:** Finds the best pin assignments, prioritizing stable hardware buses and respecting power constraints.
- **Explainable Decisions:** Tells you why it made each choice, so you learn and stay in control.

## Adding More Components

You can expand your component library in two ways:

### 1. Manually Add a Component

To add a single new component, you can add its definition directly to the `componentData` object in `data/components.js`.

### 2. Import a Component Pack

You can import a JSON file containing multiple component definitions. In the "Add Components" section of the sidebar, click the "Import" icon (📁) and select your component pack file. The new components will be added and saved in your browser for future sessions.

**Component Template:**

```javascript
// This is the structure for a single component inside a pack file or data/components.js
new_component_id: {
  name: 'Component Name',
  icon: 'fas fa-icon-name', // FontAwesome icon
  tip: 'Brief description for users',
  voltage: '3.3V or 5V',
  complexity: 'simple|moderate|complex',
  requires: {
    data: ['gpio|i2c|spi|uart'],
    power: 1,    // Number of power pins needed
    ground: 1    // Number of ground pins needed
  },
  dependencies: [], // Additional components needed
  notes: 'Important usage notes'
}
```

To add new boards, extend the `boardData` object with new board definitions, including pin layouts and specifications.

## Development Tips

- **Components not appearing:** Check the browser console for JavaScript errors.
- **Drag & drop not working:** Ensure touch polyfill is loaded.
- **Images not loading:** Verify image paths and file existence.
- **Export not working:** Check browser permissions for file downloads.

### Testing

This project uses QUnit for unit testing. To run the tests:

1. Make sure you are running the project from a local web server (like VS Code's Live Server).
2. Navigate to the `/tests/tests.html` file in your browser.

**Browser Requirements:**

- Modern browser with ES6 support
- File download permissions for export features
- Local storage for project saving

**Next Steps:**

- Add missing images for boards (`images/Raspberry Pi 4B.png`, `images/arduino_schematics_pins.png`, `images/ESP32_schematics_pins.png`)
- Test all functionality thoroughly
- Consider adding more board types (Arduino Nano, ESP8266, etc.)
- Implement user feedback from testing
- Plan Pro features development timeline
